        Ever wondered how to light a candle in 30 steps? Contraption is all about complexifying
        the simplest of things you see around yourself. Its whole essence lies in a perfectly

        \n\n4. Minimum 10 steps should be involved to complete the task otherwise team will be disqualified.
        However there is no constrain on maximum no. of steps.
        \n\n5. Minimum 4 different energy conversion should be implemented in machine. Otherwise team will be disqualified.
        \n\n6. Machine should perform the task in maximum of 4 minutes.
        \n\n7. Machine should not take support of any of four walls and ceiling.
        \n\n8. Teams have to submit abstract and flowchart in prescribed format well before the deadline for first round.
        \n\n9. Maximum of three trials/chances will be given to any team. For every other chance/trial
        there will be deduction of points.
        \n\n10. For every next chance reset time of 15 mins will be given to team.
        \n\n11. Only one team member is allowed to interact with the machine once the evaluation has begun.
        This includes resetting the machine during the run. This means that only one person will be
        allowed inside the arena. However, if the team goes for another run, the restriction of one
        person inside the arena is uplifted until the machine is ready for the other run.
        \n\n12. That person will explain about the machine and each step going on to judges.
        \n\n13. Each step in the machine should be considered as the transfer of one energy into another.
        A step is considered to accomplish when there is energy transformation. Example ball coming
        down from the wedge and hitting the domino is consider a step. In this potential energy of
        ball gets changed into kinetic energy while coming down and when it hits the domino, it transfers
        its energy to domino.
        \n\n14. Identical transfers of energy in succession should be considered one step. For eg., a set
        of dominos falling into each other should be considered one step. While technically each
        single domino falling is a step, stating one hundred steps for hundred dominos is repetitive
        and against the spirit of Rube Goldberg.
        \n\n15. You can use any material for making of your machine provided in any case , they does not
        lead damage to arena and other machines. Otherwise it will lead to disqualification of team.
        \n\n16. Hazardous materials are not allowed and any gas or any explosives are also not allowed.
        However you can use matchstick if required provided it does not damage the arena and any other
        Machine.
        \n\n17. We will not provide you any material for making of your Machine. However basic stationary
        materials will be provided to you.
        \n\n18. If required extension boards will be provided to you. But we would really appreciate if
        you bring of your own.
